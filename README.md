- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to apply a filter on a image, I freshed up my knowledge on CSS Grid and I learned to work with a mobile first workflow.

### Continued development

I want to get better at CSS grid.

### Useful resources

I used AI to figure out how to apply a filter on a image in CSS. I do have a few resources that may be helpful if someone is also gets stuck here.
- [Developer mozilla linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - You can apply the purple color as a gradiant on the image.
- [Developer mozilla background-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) - You can find more information about background-blend-mode that you need to make a color blend.
